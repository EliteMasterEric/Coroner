# Coroner
A Lethal Company mod which overhauls the end-of-mission performance report with new information, including cause of death for any deceased players with some fun easter eggs thrown in too. Available to download from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/EliteMasterEric/Coroner/) or view the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/Coroner).

> **NOTE:** If you have issues when using foreign language fonts, install FontFixer via [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/EliteMasterEric/FontFixer/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/FontFixer) BEFORE reporting.

### Issues
If you encounter any issues with the mod, please report them on the [Lethal Company Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/lcmod) or via the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/Coroner/issues). Please ensure you check for known issues on the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/Coroner/issues) or [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/Coroner/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) BEFORE reporting.

# Languages
As of v1.5.0, Coroner has support for multiple languages, and you're able to create your own translations if they're inaccurate or your language isn't available! To choose your language, open the config file for the mod (or use the [Thunderstore app](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager)/[R2modman](https://r2modman.net/) config editor).

For more information on translations, or how to add/edit your language, please check [`TRANSLATING.md`](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/Coroner/blob/master/TRANSLATING.md).

## Custom Language Data

If you want to augment or replace the language data for Coroner and share it with your friends, follow [this guide](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/Coroner/blob/master/MODDING.md#replacing-language-strings) to learn how to make a modpack which does this.

DO NOT reupload Coroner to the Thunderstore just to make changes to the language files. This will cause players to use outdated versions of the mod and harm development.
