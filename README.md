# Coroner
A Lethal Company plugin which overhauls the end-of-mission performance report with new information, including cause of death for any deceased players with some fun easter eggs thrown in too. Available to download from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/EliteMasterEric/Coroner/) or view the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/Coroner).

> **NOTE:** If you have issues when using foreign language fonts, install FontFixer via [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/EliteMasterEric/FontFixer/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/FontFixer) BEFORE reporting.

# Translations and Customization
## Translations
Coroner has support for multiple languages, and you're able to create your own translations if they're inaccurate or your language isn't available! Choose your language's code from the [List of Available Translations](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/Coroner/blob/master/TRANSLATING.md#list-of-available-translations), and edit the `LanguagePicker` option in the config file for the mod (or use the [Thunderstore app](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager)/[R2modman](https://r2modman.net/) config editor).

For more information on translations, or how to add/edit your language, please check [`TRANSLATING.md`](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/Coroner/blob/master/TRANSLATING.md).

## Create or Edit Custom Death Messages

Coroner provides the ability to add or replace the death messages provided in the default languages, and these edits can be shared with your friends via a user created mod. Check out [this guide](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/Coroner/blob/master/MODDING.md#replacing-language-strings) for more information.

It is urged that you follow this guide and **do not** reupload Coroner to Thunderstore in order to make changes to the language files. It will cause you, your friends, and others to use an outdated version of the mod, which harms development and may have severe impacts on gameplay, performance, and security.
