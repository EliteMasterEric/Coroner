All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Known Issues
- Reinstalling the mod may sometimes cause modded language data to be deleted.

# 2.2.0 (2024-09-06)
This update improves the documentation as well as adds support for v64.

### Added
- Added cause of death for the new event in v64.
### Changed
- Improved documentation for the modding API and translations (major thanks to Jatc251!).
### Fixed

# 2.1.0 (2024-08-28)
This update finalizes the modding API!

### Added
- Added cause of death for the new enemy in v61.
- Finished up the Modding API!
    - See the [modding docs](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/Coroner/blob/master/MODDING.md) for more info.
    - Check out the [Coroner Mimic plugin](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/Coroner-Mimics) for an example of how to implement this
- Split up cause of death for pits to differentiate between different tiles.
    - Added specific cause of death for that one pit in the Facility. You know the one.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue with fallback behavior (for when a language is missing translations).

# 2.0.0 (2024-07-14)
This update represents a major refactor of Coroner's codebase.

### Added
- Added new causes of death for version 50.
- Added new causes of death for version 55/56.
- Added a cause of death specifically for dying of falling in pits in the facility.
- Split up causes of death for coworkers murdering with different weapons into different types (for example, Stop Signs vs Knives).
- Added a documented `Coroner.API` class to make it easy for mods to add their own integrations.
    - NOTE: This feature is not currently 100% complete as mods cannot display their own custom causes of death right now.
- Added a `test` language which displays generic death messages for debugging purposes.

### Changed
- Replaced `LC_API` with `StaticNetcodeLib` for more reliable, less bloated networking that doesn't depend on an outdated library.

### Removed
- Removed all languages except for English, due to the other languages now having missing causes of death. A long-term solution for this problem will come later.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where leaving the game before the Performance Report and then joining a new lobby would not clear causes of death, resulting in incorrect causes of death being displayed later.

### Known Issues
- Coroner may sometimes fail to distinguish between the driver and passenger of the Company Cruiser.
- Languages other than English may be missing causes of death, they should fall back to English if one is missing.

# 1.6.2 (2024-03-05)
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where Coroner fails to detect the config folder (even when it is in the proper location).

# 1.6.1 (2024-03-04)
### Fixed
- Improved the clarity of the error messages for when people install the mod incorrectly (you won't get this error if you use R2Modman!).

# 1.6.0 (2024-02-03)
### Added
- Added new custom messages for specific causes of death:
    - Holding a Stun Grenade
    - Extension Ladder
- Added support for the expanded Unicode character set while [FontFixer](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/EliteMasterEric/FontFixer/) is installed.
- Added a new Spanish localization.
- Added a new German localization.
- Added a new Italian localization.
- Added a new Korean localization.
- Added a new Hungarian localization.
- Added a new Chinese (Simplified) localization.
- Added a new Portuguese (Brazilian) localization.

### Changed
- Numerous translation changes.
    - The English Translation now has additional notes to assist other translators.
- Moved the localization files into the config folder.
    - This should allow modpacks to properly override them.
- Changed translation handling to fallback to English if specific lines are missing.
    - This applies when some lines are present and some aren't.

### Fixed
- Fixes for Lethal Company v49.

# 1.5.3
### Fixed
- Fixed a build issue with 1.5.2.

# 1.5.2
### Fixed
- Attempting to fix an issue caused when installing Coroner without R2Modman.

# 1.5.1
### Added
- Added a new French localization.

### Changed
- I have removed LC_API as a dependency from the manifest. Coroner on its own does a reasonable job of synchronizing cause of death messages across clients without it, in my experience, to a greater extent than I originally thought. I do not anticipate making it a dependency again in the future. Apologies for the inconvenience.
- Improved the Dutch localization.

# 1.5.0
### Added
- Added a new localization feature! Coroner now has official support for English, Dutch, and Russian.
    - If you want to help localize Coroner for other languages, please visit the Lethal Company Modding Discord or submit a pull request on GitHub, I would GREATLY appreciate your contributions.

### Changed
- LC_API has been readded as a dependency after the 3.0.0 update fixed all the weird bugs.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where vanilla notes would be replaced with funny notes (funny notes should only display if no vanilla ones were given)
- Fixed an issue where "Funny Notes" were not randomized when serious death messages were turned on.

# 1.4.2
### Added
- Now includes the mod lel

# 1.4.1
### Removed
- I decided you folks had it too good *yoinks mod away*

# 1.4.0
### Added
- Added custom death messages for specific types of explosions:
    - Landmines
    - Jetpack
    - Lightning
- Added custom death message for Turrets.
- Added a `SeriousDeathMessages` config option to display only more to-the-point death messages. Defaults to `false`.

### Changed
- The death report now says "Cause of Death" instead of "Notes" when a player dies.
- Decreased log verbosity to improve performance.

# 1.3.1
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where an exception in one of the cause-of-death patches would cause the player to not die.
- Fixed an issue where not having LC_API installed would cause an exception to occur.

# 1.3.0
### Added
- Additional death messages for other death types.
- Added new death messages for the enemies from v45.

### Fixed
- Fixed some bugs related to v45.

    - Hoarder Bug
    - Hygrodere
    - Spore Lizard
    - Thumper

### Removed
- Removed LC_API as a dependency from the manifest (Thunderstore was enforcing it as mandatory rather than optional). It is still recommended that players install LC_API alongside this if possible.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where Bunkers Spiders were called Sand Spiders.
- Fixed an issue where the mod ZIP was included inside the mod ZIP, causing a console error.

# 1.1.0

- Fixed the cause of death not being evaluated properly when drowning in Quicksand.
