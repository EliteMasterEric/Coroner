# Translating
In order to create a translation, create a copy of the [`Strings_en.xml`](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/Coroner/blob/master/LanguageData/Strings_en.xml) file and change the file name to replace the `en` with your language's code from [ISO 639-1](https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-code). A list of these codes can be easily found and searched via [this list on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes). It's best to copy from the English translation as it will always be the most up to date version of the translation values. If your language isn't apart of ISO 639-1, choose a two-character code (or append a two-character code if you're creating a translation for a locale, such as Simplified (`zh-cn`) or Traditional (`zh-tw`) Chinese, or American (`en-us`) or British (`en-uk`) English) which most accurately represents your language, provided it isn't already used in ISO 639-1.

When you've finalized your translation, ensure that you add or edit your translation's information (such as version) below under the [List of Available Translations](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/Coroner/blob/master/TRANSLATING.md#list-of-available-translations), as well as adding yourself to the contributors with a link to your GitHub profile.

# Create or Edit Custom Death Messages
